    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm [jiban jyoti], college is special to them because it is a place that gives them a lot of experiences and learning. My college, srinix which is located in the East Campus and is a part of the prestigious University of Delhi is extremely special to me. It has a great record of exceptional performance of students not only in academics but also in extra-curricular activities and events.

There are a lot of opportunities, especially in academics for us to explore. I have made a lot of friends here who are so helpful and caring. Also, the professors are accommodating and polite with abundant knowledge. And the canteen has great food at affordable prices which is quite good. The environment of my college is very welcoming. I am glad to be a part of this college. .</p>
